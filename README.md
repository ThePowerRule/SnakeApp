# SnakeApp

This project is an application that allows users to program a snake and compete against other snakes on the web.  It serves as a client to ThePowerRule's SnakeServer application.  Although two test snakes are provided, it is up to users to program intelligent snakes that can compete in online arenas.

Installation instructions can be found on the [SnakeApp Wiki](https://github.com/ThePowerRule/SnakeApp/wiki).

Note: Although this repository will always contain the source code for SnakeApp, a JAR file will be periodically released to allow SnakeApp to work on all Java development software.
